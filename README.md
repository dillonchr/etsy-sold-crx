# Etsy Sold!
This is a Google Chrome extension that can extract the sale price of an out-of-stock Etsy listing and display in a friendly way automatically.

## Usage
You have two options to use this plugin:
1. You can install this plugin from the [Chrome WebStore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/etsy-sold/ogkbkoekfaofdlijmahfapjfojckiikf)
1. You can clone this repo and [install the unpacked extension manually](http://techapple.net/2015/09/how-to-install-load-unpacked-extension-in-google-chrome-browser-os-chromebooks/)

I'd recommend the first option if you're not interested in development on this extension.
